# Analysis of Rideshare Data
## Overview
  This deep dive was completed in order to highlight differences in rideshares between urban, suburban, and rural cities.
## Results
  The majority of rides were from urban cities. Urban cities also claim the largest pool of drivers, and largest amount of fares. However, the average fare by both drivers and rides is lowest for urban cities. Although rural rides are the most expensive, they make up the least amount of trips.

## Recommendations
  * Make rural trips less expensive to promote more rideshare use in these areas. 
  * A slight increase in urban fares will offset the change in rural trip fare and increase overall profitability.
  * Increasing the driver's share of the fare for rural and suburban trips will incentivize better service availability in those areas.
